# Welcome to the Natural Sciences Launchpad

*Victoria Atkins was a third-year Natural Sciences student, studying STS and physics, until she gradauted in September 2023. She has written a short piece discussing what she wishes she had known before starting at UCL:*

Welcome NatSci Freshers! Congratulations on securing your place at UCL. I am writing to give you some advice as someone who has just finished her first year on the course.

My first piece of advice is one that I’m certain will apply to everyone. If you have any questions no matter how small or large, contacting the university asap is the best way to find the answers you need. I would recommend contacting your Programme Manager (whose job is to help you) and the sooner you contact them the sooner it can be solved - for us this is **Rebecca Spencer**.

This is closely followed giving yourself time to sort accommodation. Whether it be private/university provided, or shared/single making sure you know what you want should be a priority. Don’t forget budgets and locations! Especially now the world is turning to working from home please remember commuting is a great option to save money if you are lucky enough to live close enough. Regarding accommodation: some of the best advice I received was to get a mattress topper! They are lifesavers! They’ll make any bed comfier; they are super cheap, plus it’s nice to have a layer between you and a mattress used by someone else before you!

Three years ago, I and many of my peers would have loved to have known that the university can be flexible when it comes to modules, streams and courses in the first few weeks of term one.  Don’t panic if it turns out your first choice isn’t exactly what you are after, UCL will help you as much as they can. However, make sure to check out the grade requirements for your modules. Despite grade boundaries for degree entrance there can be other more specific requirements for certain modules/streams so make sure to find out before getting your heart set on one! The same goes for which modules you’ll need to take if you want to take particular ones in later years.

Please make sure to familiarise yourself with the mental health services that the university offers and how you can access them from home. Even if you think you won’t need them it’s still good to know what’s available and how to help if friends need some support. Don’t forget to keep an eye on friends as they may struggle with the process. Make sure to stay in contact with family and friends from home as being away can make you homesick at times. Enjoy living/studying in the world’s greatest city! But equally take time for yourself, eat well, and stay active.

Budgeting for London is expensive, especially for students! Plan with your finance and expect to spend more than you do when living at home. Also, if you receive a student loan from the UK government, remember that studying in London means a slightly higher maintenance loan is granted - for good reason! UCL has some great info on how to budget so do check it out. I also recommend checking out some YouTube content on student budgeting in London.

Once you arrive do get involved in some enrichment activities. There will certainly be societies for any talents or hobbies you may have and if there isn’t why not make one! This is a great way to meet people outside your course especially if you aren’t living in halls or are studying online.

Whilst the friendships that you make in freshers’ week don’t tend to be lifelong it will work out in the end. Finding people to live with in your second year is super exciting but don’t panic, you don’t have to be best friends to be flatmates! Enjoy the process of meeting new, like-minded students and friends will find you. Reaching out to other freshers online is a great way to network especially whilst we continue studying online. There are lots of Facebook groups and WhatsApp chats to stick your teeth into: all you need to do is start looking!

I hope you have found this useful!

Thanks for reading,

Victoria Atkins
