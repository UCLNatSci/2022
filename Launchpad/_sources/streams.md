# The Streams
In your first term at UCL, you will choose three ‘foundation’ modules, and study these alongside an introductory mathematics module. The foundation modules you choose should be related to the possible streams you would like to take subsequently. Prior to second term, you will then confirm your ‘stream combination’, referring to the two science subjects that will make up the bulk of your study at UCL. The streams you can take are listed below. Each link goes into more depth about the subject and lists the possible stream combinations that you can choose. After your first year, you will choose one of your streams as your major, meaning that you will take the majority of your classes in that area. If you go into fourth year and undertake a masters’ project in natural sciences, your project will be conducted in your major stream. 

Refer to this page for a summary of permitted stream combinations.
