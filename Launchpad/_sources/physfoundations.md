# PHAS0011 Modern Physics, Astronomy and Cosmology

*About:*
This module aims to introduce students to new concepts in quantum physics which underlies much of Modern 
Physics (including Medical Physics) and Astronomy and Cosmology; approach the frontiers of understanding in 
Modern Physics (including Medical Physics) and Astrophysics and Cosmology; introduce students to experimental 
physics in the university context.

*Highlights:*
You will gain a broad overview of all areas of study under Physics. The section on Modern Physics sets out 
foundational concepts in quantum physics. Medical Physics enable you to explore physics and engineering as 
applied to medicine, especially imaging and other diagnostic methods. The module also covers the exciting area 
of modern Astrophysics, with materials bringing you right up to the frontiers of discovery including topics 
such as black holes, gravity waves, exoplanets, dark matter and dark energy.

*Prerequisites:*
In order to take this module, students should have A-levels in Maths and Physics (or equivalent). Students must 
be able to differentiate and be familiar with the basic principles for example of diffraction, electromagnetism, 
classical mechanics, forces. No previous knowledge of Quantum Physics, Astronomy or Cosmology is required.

*Contents (indicative):*
There are four parts to this course in total:

- **Modern Physics** - This part of the course covers the remarkable development of Quantum Mechanics a 
century or so ago. Topics include:
	- Breakdown of Classical Physics (Young's double-slit experiment, Michelson-Morley experiment, 
	Blackbody radiation and Planck quantization; photoelectric effect; particle/wave duality;)
	- Quantum Theory (The de Brogle conjecture; electron diffraction, the wavefunction; Uncertainty 
	Principle; Schrödinger equation; tunnelling)
	- Atoms (Atomic spectra, Hydrogen models, solution of Hydrogen atom with Schrödinger equation: 
	spherical coordinates, eigenfunctions, quantum numbers)

- **Medical Physics** - The underlying physics behind each of the different medical imaging methods is described, 
as are the physical mechanisms which produce image contrast. The clinical uses of the alternative techniques 
are explored, and the reasons for selecting a given method are discussed based on the information provided 
and the risk/benefit to the patient. The primary diagnostic imaging procedures includes:
	- X-ray imaging, including angiography. 
	- X-ray computed tomography
	- Diagnostic ultrasound, including Doppler imaging
	- Magnetic resonance imaging
	- Medical imaging using radioisotopes
	- Electroencephalography

- **Astronomy and Cosmology** - This portion of the course aims to introduce the excitement of modern astronomy 
and our current understanding of the contents and nature of the universe. As an observational science, 
astronomy relies on the interpretation of radiation over a wide range of frequencies received from 
celestial sources.
	- Clasification of stars (stellar luminosity, effective temperature and spectral types)
	- Energy generation and the evolution of stars
	- Overview of galaxies, Hubble’s law and the Big Bang model; concepts of inflation
	- Introduce mysteries related to the nature of dark matter and dark energy

- **Experimental Physics** - This includes activities to explore your understanding of the purpose of experimental labs and your understanding of the application of experimental processes such as measurement and experimental design. They will require creativity and collaboration with your partner to ensure success.
Familiarisation with basic laboratory skills
Use of computer packages for the analysis of experiments

*Teaching:*

- **Lectures:** The three topics the course covers (atomic spectra, atomic structure and the periodic table, mechanism and stereochemistry) will be introduced through lectures. Pre-prepared handouts may be provided by the lecturer, either electronically or as a paper copy. The lecturer may additionally require you to make your own notes during the lecture. In addition, you may be referred to material (for example in textbooks or on the web) to read and assimilate. Lectures are Lecturecast where the facilities are available; however attendance at the lectures is considered an indicator of student engagement and is therefore compulsory.

- **Workshops:** Your learning is supported by nine small-group workshops (three per topic). Qualifying work will be made available a week prior to the workshop; this must be attempted and submitted via Moodle before the workshop. During the workshop you will attempt further questions with the support of academic staff member. After the workshop you will provide on-line feedback to other students on their work via an assessed ‘peer marking’ assignment. Workshops are an opportunity to receive feedback on your understanding of the module material, hence preparation and active participation is essential if you wish to derive the most benefit. Workshop attendance is monitored and compulsory.

- **Self-study:** In addition to timetabled hours it is expected that you engage in self-study in order to master the material. This can take the form of practicing example questions (workshop questions, additional questions available on Moodle and past exam questions); participating in peer marking, preparing for laboratory sessions and writing up reports and further reading in textbooks and online.

- **Laboratories:** There are three practical sessions that you must attend. These practicals support understanding of the module material as well as teaching essential skills for a practicing chemist. As laboratory skills are an essential aspect of this programme, attendance in the laboratory sessions is monitored and compulsory.

*Assessment:*

- 60% Examination

- 20% Laboratory work

- 20% Coursework
