# BIOS0019 Life Sciences Foundation

*About:*
This foundation module will introduce you to general ideas on how life is organized (and studied) at progressively larger scales: from biomolecules and cells, to organisms, to biomes and their evolution. The focus is on mechanisms: structure and function of biopolymers, how they are organized and integrated to build cells, how cells, tissues and organs are regulated and coordinated in organisms, how organisms evolve to interact with the physical and biological environment and the genetic basis of these processes. You will learn to appreciate some of the complexity and diversity of life processes, and different approaches to the study of organisms, their molecular, cellular and physiological processes, their genetics and evolution, and the interrelationships between them and their environment. 

*Highlights:*
Students will gain a broad overview of all areas of study under Life Sciences (Molecular and Cell Biology; Biomedical Sciences; Neuroscience and Psychology; Genetics, Evolution, Environment). Following a series of introductory lectures, students will be able to work in groups to research and present an interdisciplinary topic of their choice to peers. You will communicate key ideas on the organization of life and the interdisciplinary methods by which it is studied, and assess your own and othersâ€™ performance. 

*Prerequisites:*
The life sciences streams variously require biologh or chemistry A-levels or equivalents, although some streams this is just a recomendation.

*Contents (indicative):*

**A) Introductory molecular biology and protein structure/function**

- Biopolymers - Nucleic acids - structure, bases, DNA, RNA, copying, transcription, tRNA
- Biopolymers - Proteins - amino acids, structural elements
- Enzymes and metabolism - catalysts, protein properties, regulation
- The nucleus - chromatin, chromosomes import/export, cell cycle
- The cytoplasm - small molecules to organelles
- The cytoplasm (again) and membranes - cytoskeleton, general features of membrane structure

**B) Basic cell physiology, signal transduction and neurobiology**

- Processes at membranes: transporters, pumps, ion channels; membrane and action potentials
- Introduction to cell signalling (GPCRs + TRK)
- Introduction to the Nervous System I: Neurons, action potentials, impulse propagation
- Introduction to the Nervous System II: Neurons, synapses and neurotransmitters
- Central, Autonomic and Enteric Nervous Systems.

**C) Selected topics in genetics, evolution and environment**

- Natural selection in living colour
- Climate change and coral reefs
- Biology of ageing
- Evolution of the eukaryotic cell
