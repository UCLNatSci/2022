# Welcome to the Natural Sciences Launchpad

![image](launchpad.jpg)

This is an all-in-one place for the essential information you will need to prepare for the start of term 
and to the start of your undergraduate journey. For the **First Steps**, you will be able to find basic 
introduction to UCL, the Natural Sciences programme and the programme tutors who are your go-to personnel 
for any course-related problems you might encounter. Under **Streams**, you can find out more about the possible 
major and minor academic themes you can pursue in Natural Sciences. The section on **Foundation Modules** provides 
more details on the specific modules you will need to choose to continue to the streams you want. We have also 
included some general UCL-related information to show you a tip of the UCL iceberg and start you off on your own exploration. There's no pressure to go through everything. Just have a look at what interest you the most and helpful to your stream decisions. New info will be released weekly so do remember to check back from time to time!
