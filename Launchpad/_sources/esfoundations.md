# GEOL0007 The Earth

*About:*
This course will provide students with an introduction to the Earth, and in particular discuss current research across the field of Earth Sciences and within the department at UCL. This module is suitable for natural science and geoscience students with no previous knowledge of geology and provides an introduction for many other earth science courses. The course aims to develop students' critical thinking and presentation skills in multiple settings, through class discussions, collaborative presentation and individual assignments.

*Highlights:*
This module aims to be a capivating and fun introduction to the field of Earth Sciences, which is a subject many will not have come across at school. Assessment focusses on practical classwork exercises and group exercises including a chance to meet one of the researcher is Earth Sciences, make a vlog and undertake a group research project to produce a digital infographic. It should not be a onerous module in this respect. Taking this module opens up opportunities in all areas of Earth Sciences as it is a prerequisiste for several Earth Science modules in future years. 

*Prerequisites:*
We expect no specific prior knowledge. However we do expect everyone to have a scientific curiosity, and an interest in finding out more about how planet Earth formed, what it was like in the geological past and how various aspects of the natural world function. Students can expect practical exercises to be numerical and use computational tools in some cases, however all content is fairly straightforward and does not require advanced mathematics.

*Contents (indicative):*

- Formation and composition of the early and modern Earth
- Plate tectonics
- Volcanic hazards
- The evolution of life
- Long-term climate change and “the climate emergency”

*Teaching:*

- **Lectures:** 

- **Practicals** There are practical sessions that you must attend. These practicals support understanding of the module material as well as teaching essential skills for an earth scientist. As these skills are an essential aspect of this programme, attendance in the laboratory sessions is monitored and compulsory.

*Assessment:*

- 40% Group Work

- 60% Coursework
