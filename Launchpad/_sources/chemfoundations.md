# CHEM0005 Chemical Foundations

*About:*
The aims of this module are to lay the foundations in the three main branches of chemistry for all 
of the subsequent courses in the Department. The course material is linked to, but extends considerably, 
A-level chemistry (or equivalent courses).

*Highlights:*
You will gain a broad overview of all areas of study under Chemistry, including practical laboratory skills. 

*Prerequisites:*
The chemistry streams require chemistry and mathematics A-levels or equivalents.

*Contents (indicative):*

- Atomic spectrum of hydrogen, explaining the spectra of sodium and helium
- Bohr model, quantum numbers, spin-orbit coupling, properties of electromagnetic radiation, 
experimental principles and the Zeeman effect
- Atomic structure and bonding, and how these explain the concepts of periodicity
- Basic principles of molecular orbital theory and its application to bonding
- Rationalise and represent a mechanism for a chemical reaction using the curly arrow notation, 
incorporating stereochemical and reactivity considerations
- Basic principles of aromatic chemistry
- Laboratory skills (risk assessment, collecting experimental data, calculations and analysis, 
interpretation and presentation of results, maintain accurate records in your laboratory notebook)

*Recommended readings:*

<u>Inorganic chemistry:</u>
- **Revision:** Read Chapter 1 of M. J. Winter, Chemical Bonding, 2nd edition, Oxford Chemistry Primers (OUP), 2016.

*Teaching:*

- **Lectures:** The three topics the course covers (atomic spectra, atomic structure and the periodic table, mechanism and stereochemistry) will be introduced through lectures. Pre-prepared handouts may be provided by the lecturer, either electronically or as a paper copy. The lecturer may additionally require you to make your own notes during the lecture. In addition, you may be referred to material (for example in textbooks or on the web) to read and assimilate. Lectures are Lecturecast where the facilities are available; however attendance at the lectures is considered an indicator of student engagement and is therefore compulsory.

- **Workshops:** Your learning is supported by nine small-group workshops (three per topic). Qualifying work will be made available a week prior to the workshop; this must be attempted and submitted via Moodle before the workshop. During the workshop you will attempt further questions with the support of academic staff member. After the workshop you will provide on-line feedback to other students on their work via an assessed ‘peer marking’ assignment. Workshops are an opportunity to receive feedback on your understanding of the module material, hence preparation and active participation is essential if you wish to derive the most benefit. Workshop attendance is monitored and compulsory.

- **Self-study:** In addition to timetabled hours it is expected that you engage in self-study in order to master the material. This can take the form of practicing example questions (workshop questions, additional questions available on Moodle and past exam questions); participating in peer marking, preparing for laboratory sessions and writing up reports and further reading in textbooks and online.

- **Laboratories:** There are three practical sessions that you must attend. These practicals support understanding of the module material as well as teaching essential skills for a practicing chemist. As laboratory skills are an essential aspect of this programme, attendance in the laboratory sessions is monitored and compulsory.

*Assessment:*

- 60% Online examination

- 20% Laboratory work

- 20% Coursework
