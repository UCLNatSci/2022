# Foundation Modules
These are the foundation modules available to you as introduction to each of the streams. Each page has a 
summary of the general purpose of the module, its contents, prerequisites and some readings to familiarise 
with the subject. All of the modules are taught in Term 1.

Browse through the options available at your leisure, but only make the selection during Induction week when 
you would have received all relevant information. The deadline for finalising your foundation modules is 
during induction week.

The six foundation modules are:

- CHEM0005 Chemical Foundations

- PHAS0011 Modern Physics, Astronomy and Cosmology

- BIOS0019 Life Sciences Foundations

- GEOL0007 The Earth

- STAT0002 Introduction to Probability and Statistics

- HPSC0009 Introduction to History, Philosophy and Social Studies of Science

You are **STRONGLY** advised to pick HPSC0009 (Introduction to History, Philosophy and Social Studies of Science) 
OR GEOL0007 (The Earth) as your third foundation module if you have a clear sense of what your streams will 
be - neither of these have any subject study prior to university required, both are assessed in Term 1 
only through course work and both will give you additional breadth within sciences and make you more 
interdisciplinary. You are of course free to pick *whichever* foundation modules you wish (provided you meet the entry requirements for the stream) - but please keep in mind the combinations of streams you wish to proceed on to.
