# First Steps
Here are some basics to help you familiarise with the campus, the Natural Sciences programme and the people 
you will be in regular contact with. When in doubt, do note your top 3 points of contact:

1. Consult the [Natural Sciences Handbook](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/natural-sciences/sites/natural_sciences/files/natsci_programme_handbook_2022-23.pdf) to clarify any details regarding the Natural Sciences programme. You 
can look up key information about the programme structure, module selection guideline, grade classificaion 
and progression requirements (please note this is the 2022-23 version, the 2023-24 version will be available shortly after you start).

2. If you have further inquiries about the Natural Sciences programme, direct them to the dedicated 
[mailbox](mailto:natsci@ucl.ac.uk).  The core members of the Natural Sciences team have access to this, so you are 
ensured to receive a response from someone who can best answer your query.

3. Log into UCLâ€™s self-help centre and online student enquiry system, **[askUCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/askucl)**, for general UCL-related questions, such as about getting transcripts, booking an appointment with a Wellbeing 
advisor, or seeking visa and immigration advice.
