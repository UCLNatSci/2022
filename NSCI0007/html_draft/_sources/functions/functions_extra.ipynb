We can estimate the volume of a solid of revolution by dividing it into a sequence of stacked discs and summing the volume of each.\n",

    "4. The estimate should get more accurate as we increase `n`. We can estimate the accuracy by calculating the difference between `sphere_vol(R, n)` and `sphere_vol(R, n-1)`. For `R = 1`, how large does `n` need to be so that difference between consecutive estimates is less than $10^{-4}$?\n",
