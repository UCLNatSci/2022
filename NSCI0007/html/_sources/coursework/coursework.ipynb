    "Suppose there are two species of organism which live in a neighbourhood consisting of a square grid of cells. Populations of the two species are initially placed into random locations of a neighbourhood represented by a grid. After placing all the organisms in the grid, each cell is either occupied by an organism or is empty as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](grid1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The organisms prefer to be surrounded by organisms of the same type. An organism is *satisfied* if it is surrounded by at least a fraction $f$ of organisms that are of a like species.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if $f = 0.3$, an organism is satisfied if at least 30% of its neighbours are the same species as itself. If the organism is satisfied, then it will remain in its current location. If fewer than 30% are the same species, then the organism is not satisfied, and it will want to change its location in the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The picture below (left) shows a satisfied organism because 50% of X's neighbors are also X ($50\\% > f$). The next X (right) is not satisfied because only 25% of its neighbors are X ($25\\% < f$). Notice that empty cells are not counted when calculating similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](grid2.png) ![](grid3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When an organism is not satisfied, it is moved to any vacant location in the grid. The new location is chosen at random from amongst the empty cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image below (left), all dissatisfied organisms have an asterisk next to them. The image on the right shows the new configuration after all the dissatisfied organisms have been moved to unoccupied cells at random. Note that the new configuration may cause some organisms which were previously satisfied to become dissatisfied!\n",
    "\n",
    "![](grid4.png) ![](grid5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "All dissatisfied organisms are moved in the same round. After the round is complete, a new round begins, and dissatisfied organisms are once again moved to new locations in the grid. These rounds continue until all organisms in the neighbourhood are satisfied with their location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The animation below shows an example of how the distribution of two populations might evolve. Notice that the distribution eventually settles down to a stable pattern with organisms segregated into distinct regions.\n",
