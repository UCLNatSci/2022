    "You will produce a Python notebook which simulates the movement of organisms around a neighbourhood. In Part 1 (35 marks) you will build the model, and in Part 2 (15 marks) you will investigate the behaviour of the model for various values of its parameters.\n",

    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been provided a new Cocalc project called `[your name] - NSCI0007 COURSEWORK 22/23` which contains a folder `COURSEWORK_FILES`. The contents of this folder will be automatically collected at the end of the assessment period.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there are two species of organism living in a neighbourhood. The organisms are initially spread about the neighbourhood at random, but are free to move around the neighbourhood as they wish. The organisms are lazy and so in general will stay where they are; however they have a slight preference for being surrounded by organisms of the same species. If too many of their immediate neighbours are of the opposite species, they will move to another location in the neighbourhood. Over time, the distribution of organisms will shift ({numref}`fig-neighbourhood`).\n",

    ":name: \"fig-neighbourhood\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Organisms of two species (blue and green) are initially spread around the neighbourhood at random, with some cells empty (white). At each time step, dissatisfied organisms move into unoccupied cells, resulting in shifting patterns of organism locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The neighbourhood consists of a square grid of cells, each of which is either empty or occupied by an organism of one of the two species. Populations of the two species are initially placed into random locations of a neighbourhood represented by a grid ({numref}`grid1_fig`).\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The organisms prefer to be surrounded by organisms of the same type. An organism is *satisfied* if it is surrounded by at least a fraction $f$ of organisms that are of a like species.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that $f = 0.3$, meaning that an organism is satisfied when at least 30% of its neighbours are the same species as itself. If the organism is satisfied, then it will remain in its current location. If fewer than 30% are the same species, then the organism is not satisfied, and it will want to change its location in the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "{numref}`grid2_fig` (left) shows a satisfied organism because 50% of X's neighbors are also X $(50\\% > f)$. The next X (right) is dissatisfied because only 25% of its neighbours are X $(25\\% < f)$. Notice that empty cells are not counted when calculating similarity.\n",
