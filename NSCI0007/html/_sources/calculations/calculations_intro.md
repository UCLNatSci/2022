# Computations

Programming is all about breaking down a problem into simple steps that the computer can understand. In this case, the 'simple steps' are instructions, written in the Python programming language, which perform simple operations such as performing arithmetic calculations or setting the value of variables. These instructions are usually performed one at a time in sequence, although some instructions might cause the program to branch to a different section of code or to repeat a section of code. In this section we will introduce some of the most common Python constructs and some techniques to solve simple computational problems.

```{admonition} What you'll learn
:class: tip
 - How to create variables
 - How to perform arithmetic calcuations
 - Displaying output using `print`
 - Branching using the `if` statement
 - Looping using the `while` statement
 - Using pseudocode to construct the solution to a problem
```

**Before class** read and complete the exercises in [](calculations_notes.ipynb)

**During class** work on Tutorial 1

**After class** complete and submit the homework exercise
