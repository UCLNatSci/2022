    "## Order of magnitude\n",
    "\n",
    "When describing the smallness or bigness of numbers it can be helpful to classify them into powers of a given reference quantity (called the base). Customarily we use base 10, though base 2 is used to describe computer memory, and in advanced mathematics it is common to use a base defined by a property of the system being investigated. We may denote the order of magnitude using the symbol $\\mathcal{O}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In base 10, the order of magnitude is given by the power in scientific notation. For example, the value $3.124\\times 10^3$ is $\\mathcal{O}(10^3)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An order of magnitude estimate keeps only the most significant digit in scientific number format. For instance, an order of magnitude estimate for the number of humans on Earth is $8\\times 10^{9}$. More precise values can be used in the steps towards working out an order of magnitude estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two physical quantities are said to be the same order of magnitude if their ratio lies between 1/10 and 10. For instance, the value $6.4\\times 10^{4}$ and $1.2\\times 10^{5}$ are the same order of magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{exercise}\n",
    "By [one estimate](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2201550119) there are around $2\\times 10^{16}$ ants on Earth, with an average biomass of 0.62mg.\n",
    "\n",
    "The world population of humans is around $8 \\times 10^9$, with an average mass of 50kg including children, of which around 15% is biomass.\n",

    "## Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above discussion we assumed that $|x|<1$ so that the powers of $x$ grow successively smaller. However, it is not guaranteed that the infinite sum $p(x)$ will converge to $f(x)$ on the whole interval $[-1,1]$. By constructing the expansion to match the derivatives of $f(x)$ at $x=0$ we have only ensured that the representation is accurate in some local neighbourhood of this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to use tools of mathematical analysis to formally determine the interval of convergence for the infinite series, which will be different for each function $f(x)$. In the case of the series for $\\ln(1+x)$ it turns out that the infinite series converges to the correct value on the whole interval $[-1,1]$, albeit rather slowly for some values of $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is truly remarkable is that for some functions the expansions constructed by the method outlined above are valid over a wider interval than $[-1,1]$. In fact, the expansions for some functions are valid *for all* values of $x$. Examples include the functions $e^x$, $\\sin(x)$ and $\\cos(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is quite exciting to think that these non-polynomial functions can be represented by infinite polynomial series. However, the expansions converge increasingly slowly as we move further from the point $x=0$, which lessens their practical use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will not develop the tools of analysis required to undertake a formal investigation of convergence. We will adopt a more experimental approach, by generating series containing a few terms and evaluating their accuracy on the interval that we are interested in.\n",
