:::{solution} exercise_walks_and_paths

1\. There are 3 choices for the first node, and 2 choices for each of the 10 subsequent nodes. The total number of walks is therefore $3 Ã— 2^{10}$.

2\. Paths from node 6 to node 4: $[6,4],[6,7,4],[6,7,3,4],[6,7,3,5,4]$. Paths from node 4 to node 6: none. <br>
3\. $[2,1,3,7,6,4]$.

:::{solution} exercise_bfs

1. BFS starting at node 2:$[2,1,4,3,5,7,6]$ <br>
Path distances from node 2: $d = [1,0,2,1,3,4,3]$ where $d(i)$ is the distance from node $i$.
1. BFS starting at node 6: $[6, 4, 7, 3, 5]$ <br>
Path distances from node 6: $d = [inf, inf, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1]$

2\. For node order 1, 2, 3, 6:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
	0 & 1 & 1 & 0\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}

**Question 8**

Connected components: $[1, 5, 6, 7, 9], [4, 8], [2, 3, 10]$

**Question 9**

Strongly connected components: $[3, 6, 8], [2, 4], [1, 5, 7, 9]$


**Question 5**

1. Average path length = 1 since every node is directly connected to every other
node in both directions. Global clustering coefficient = 1 since the neighbours
of every node are all connected to each other in both directions.
2. The global clustering coefficient expresses how nodes share common neigh-
bours that connect to one another. A high clustering coefficient represents a
network with small groups of nodes that share local connections.
