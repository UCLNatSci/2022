    "## Naked planet model\n",
    "\n",
    "The naked planet model is a model of Earth's energy balance that ignores the effect of the atmosphere. It is a simple one-stock model in which the Earth is warmed by the suns rays and radiates the additional heat back to space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Energy inflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The Earth is warmed by energy radiated from the sun onto the facing surface area. The rate of incoming energy from the sun is known as the [*solar constant*](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Glory/solar_irradiance/total_solar_irradiance.html). It can be measured by satellites above the Earth's atmosphere and is [found](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X18303463) to be roughly $1361\\text{W/m}^2$. Although for historic reasons it is known as a constant, the incoming energy does vary over the solar cycle, and over the long-term life of the sun.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "One watt is equal to one joule of energy per second.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all of the energy received by the Earth is absorbed. Some of the incoming solar radiation is reflected back to space, for example due to cloud cover or due to the reflectivity of Earth's surfaces. More energy is absorbed by the oceans than by land, and areas that are covered by snow and ice have higher reflectivity than green forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fraction of energy that is reflected is known as *albedo*. It can be estimated by satellite imaging, as shown in the figure below. From such observations the Earth's average albedo is estimated to be around 29.5%.\n",

    "## Greenhouse effect\n",
    "\n",
    "The interior of a greenhouse (glass house) warms up more than its surroundings because it traps heat. Glass is fairly transparent to incoming short-wave solar radiation, but is much less transparent to the long-wave radiation that is re-emitted from surfaces in the greenhouse such as soil and plants.\n",
    "\n",
    "The atmosphere of Earth behaves in similar manner to the glass of a greenhouse, which results in less heat emitted to space than what the naked earth model predicts. Today it is possible to directly observe the greenhouse effect by comparing the amount of Earth's heat radiated from the upper atmosphere to the amount leaving the surface, but the idea that CO2 in the Earth's upper atmosphere could result in atmospheric warming appears to have been first suggested in 1856 by [Eunice Newton Foote](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/pt.6.4.20210823a/full/).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can amend the naked earth model to account for the greenhouse effect by multiplying the long wave radiation term by a fraction $1/(1+g)$ that reduces the amount of short wave radiation outflow:\n",

    "When $g=0$ we have the naked Earth model. It can be shown that when $g=1$ the equilibrium state of the model is equivalent to a hypothetical model of the Earth contained within a glass ball. Values of $g>1$ can be used to model a \"super greenhouse effect\".\n",
