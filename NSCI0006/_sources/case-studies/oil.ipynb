    "# Peak Oil\n",
    "\n",
    "Global oil peak is the year in which the world's oil production is greater than that of any year before or after. All studies cited by the US Energy Information Administration place this peak within the next 50 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: carbon budgets (output end) rather than resource depletion (input end) might be the more urgent limit to growth currently! (see pp220)\n",
    "\n",

    "## The model\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic function is a model of resource limited growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x(t)$ be the population of a given area at time $t$. It is assumed that the area has sufficient resource to support a maximum population size $C>0$, called the _carrying capacity_. Write down an expression for the fraction of remaining resource when the population size is $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{toggle}\n",
    "Fraction remaining: $\\displaystyle 1-\\frac{x}{C}$.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the per-capita rate of change of population is proportional to the fraction of available resources, with constant of proportionality $r>0$. Write down a differential equation for $x(t)$. This is the logistic model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{toggle}\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\frac{1}{x}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t}=r\\left(1-\\frac{x}{C}\\right), \\qquad x(0)=x_0.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic model can be applied not only to populations, but also to other scenarios where we anticipate exponential growth that levels off due to resource restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solving it\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric solution\n",
    "\n",
    "```{exercise}\n",
    ":label: ex-po2\n",
    "By using the discrete differentiation formula,\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "with a common difference $h=\\Delta t$, write down an expression for $x_{i+1}$ and hence obtain a numeric estimate of the curve $x(t)$ for the case where $r=1.5$, $C=75$, $x_0=1$\n",

    "\n",
    "According to the logistic model, the rate of change of population $x$ is given by the following production function:\n",

    ":label: ex-po5\n",
    "Produce a plot of the production function for parameter values $r,C$ of your choice. Describe how the growth rate changes in relation to the carrying capacity. Explain how the production curve demonstrates that the population size cannot exceed the carrying capacity in the long run.\n",

    "\n",
    "This provides a way to estimate the carrying capacity from a given dataset. We can numerically estimate the relative growth rate using a few initial points and then extrapolate to the axis. However, this can be dangerous. The pattern may not continue, or errors may be magnified.\n",

    "* In this model, $\\Delta x/\\Delta t$ is the amount of oil produced in a given year and $x$ is the cumulative amount of oil produced.\n",
    "* The relative growth rate estimate will not be accurate when $x$ is small, as small fluctuations in data values have a large impact relative to the size of $x$\n",
