# Computer simulation


We will construct numerical solution of DEs
We will visualise and interpret system dynamics
We will recognise and understand common patterns such as osciallations, growth and decay
We will consider the difference between analytic and computer models
(includes concept of integration and elementary techniques)

Solve simple ODEs analytically
Model applications using derivatives.

WIKIPEDIA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony-forming_unit
In microbiology, colony-forming unit (CFU) is a unit which estimates the number of microbial cells (bacteria, fungi, viruses etc.) in a sample that are viable, able to multiply via binary fission under the controlled conditions

Lactobacillus plantarum is a type of bacteria that causes spoilage of certain foodstuffs. The data in the file lplantarum.txt shows the relative population $N/N_0$ of L. plantarum in a particular food sample that was kept at a constant temperature of 10Â°C, with measurements taken every 5 hours up to 350 hours after inoculation.

Produce a plot of $y=\ln(N/N_0)$ against $t$ for this data.
