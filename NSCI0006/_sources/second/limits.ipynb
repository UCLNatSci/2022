    "\n",
    "In the last chapter we saw that there are times when we may want to describe the behaviour of a function as its argument *approaches* a value without actually being equal to it. This is the idea that lies behind the mathematical definition of a limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "By way of example, let us consider one of the functions that we looked at previously:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: thefrac\n",
    "y=\\frac{3x^2+2x}{1-2x}.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last chapter we described the behaviour of this function as $x$ approaches (\"tends to\") the value of 1/2. We saw that the result is different as we approach from either the left or the right side of the $x$-axis [see {numref}`asymptotes-03`]. We may mathematically denote this by writing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: oneside\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\lim_{x\\rightarrow \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{-}}y=+\\infty\\\\\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The expressions state that \"in the limit\" as $x$ tends to $\\frac{1}{2}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "* from the left, $y$ tends to positive infinity\n",
    "* from the right, $y$ tends to negative infinity\n",
    "\n",
    "These are *one-sided* limits. Since the left- and right- sided limits are not the same, we cannot meaningfully speak of the limit as $x$ tends to $\\frac{1}{2}$ without specifying the direction, as indicated by the superscript $+/-$ used in {eq}`oneside`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For comparison, consider the function $1/x^2$. As $x$ tends to zero the left- and right- sided limits of this function are both positive infinity and so we can simply say:\n",

    "In this example the limit appears to \"go like\" $\\infty - \\infty$, so you would be forgiven for thinking the result is zero. On the other hand, there is a sense in which $x^2$ is \"much bigger\" than $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, if you try to substitute a large value of $x$ into the function $(x^2 - x)$ you may infer that function can get arbitrarily large by making $x$ sufficiently large.\n",
